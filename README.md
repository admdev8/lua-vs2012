About Lua
---------
Lua is a powerful, fast, lightweight, embeddable scripting language.

Lua combines simple procedural syntax with powerful data description 
constructs based on associative arrays and extensible semantics. Lua is 
dynamically typed, runs by interpreting bytecode for a register-based 
virtual machine, and has automatic memory management with incremental 
garbage collection, making it ideal for configuration, scripting, 
and rapid prototyping.
